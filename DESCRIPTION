Description: This is the R-interface to RADEX, a statistical equilibrium
    radiative transfer code, made available for public use as part of the
    Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA). RADEX is a one-dimensional
    non-LTE radiative transfer code, that uses the escape probability
    formulation assuming an isothermal and homogeneous medium without
    large-scale velocity fields. RADEX is comparable to the LVG method and
    provides a useful tool in rapidly analyzing a large set of observational
    data providing constraints on physical conditions, such as density and
    kinetic temperature.
    The formalism adopted in RADEX is summarized in Van der Tak, F.F.S. et al.
